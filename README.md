## ✨ Overview

Alabar Site V2 is an evolution of my personal website, transforming a static portfolio into an interactive game-powered experience using Pixi.js! This version maintains the visual identity while implementing proper game mechanics, improved collision detection, and advanced design patterns.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- 🎨 **Pixi.js** - WebGL/Canvas-based rendering for smooth game performance
- 📱 **Bootstrap 5** - Responsive layout framework for all devices
- 🔄 **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)** - Using latest JS features and design patterns
- 🖌️ **HTML5/CSS3** - Structure and styling
- 🔊 **Howler.js** - Enhanced audio handling (planned)

## 🧩 Design Patterns

The project implements several design patterns for better code organization and maintainability:

- 🏭 **Factory Pattern** - Creating game entities (player, monsters)
- 👁️ **Observer Pattern** - Event handling via custom event system
- 🔄 **State Pattern** - Managing entity states (idle, walking, attacking)
- 🧱 **Component Pattern** - Entity composition system

## 🔧 Managers

The game architecture uses several manager classes to organize functionality:

- 🎞️ **AssetManager** - Handles loading and managing game assets
- 🎬 **SceneManager** - Controls scene layers and themes
- 🎮 **InputManager** - Processes keyboard inputs for player control
- ☁️ **CloudsManager** - Manages procedural cloud animations
- 🎯 **GameAreaManager** - Handles game boundaries and container positioning
- 🌈 **ParallaxEffect** - Controls the parallax scrolling effect
- 🧩 **EntityManager** - Tracks and updates all game entities (WIP)

## ✅ Key Features

### 🎮 Game Engine

- 🌟 Pixi.js rendering replaces DOM manipulation
- ⏱️ Proper game loop with delta time
- 💥 Robust collision system

### 📊 Code Organization

- 🔄 **Object-oriented approach** - Classes and components replace procedural code
- 🧩 Component-based architecture for entities
- 🧱 Clear separation between game logic and UI

### ⚡ Performance

- 📦 Asset management and preloading
- 🖼️ Sprite batching for better performance

### 🎯 Game Features

- 📏 Precise collision detection and response
- ⚔️ Combat system with special abilities
- 🤖 Enemy AI
- 🏞️ Multiple levels/areas to explore
- 🗡️ **Custom sword cursor** - Immersive themed cursor

### 🎨 UI/UX

- 🌓 Day/Night theme toggle with animated transitions
- 📱 Responsive design for various devices
- 💫 Parallax scrolling background effects
- 🌟 Loading screen with particle animations
- 🎭 **Unique animations** - Custom character and environment animations

### 🎨 Original Artwork

- 🖌️ **90% original assets** - Almost all artwork created by me
- 🌄 Custom background landscapes and environments
- 👾 Hand-crafted character sprites
- 🏰 Unique environment elements (castles, fields, mountains)
- ☁️ Custom cloud and weather effects
